# MealIntent Skill
This is a Node.js code for an Alexa skill that retrieves meal information for a given date and time.

## Functionality
The skill retrieves meal information for a given date and time using a JSON API. The JSON API provides information on meals for a given date, which is parsed and used to generate the output.

## Code
The code consists of a single handler function for the Alexa skill, which is divided into two parts: canHandle and handle.

## canHandle
This function determines whether the input provided by the user is an IntentRequest for the MealIntent. The function returns true if the input is an IntentRequest for the MealIntent and false otherwise.

## handle
This function handles the input provided by the user by retrieving the meal information for the requested date and time.

1. The user's time zone is set to "Asia/Kolkata".
2. The meal requested by the user is obtained using Alexa.getSlotValue.
3. The date requested by the user is obtained using Alexa.getSlotValue. If no date is provided, today's date is used.
4. The day of the requested date is determined using moment.js.
5. The meal information for the requested date is obtained using a JSON API.
6. The output is generated based on the meal information obtained and whether the requested date is in the future.
7. The output is then returned as a response to the user's request.
