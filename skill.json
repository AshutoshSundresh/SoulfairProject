Identify the specific day requested by the user as well as key words used such as tomorrow, yesterday and today.\n2. Identify whether only lunch or breakfast information is required. Fallback to providing both lunch and breakfast information if there\u0027s no explicit command for either one of them.\n3. Properly handle a situation where no data is available.\n\nSource code: https://github.com/AshutoshSundresh/SoulfairProject",
